# my collection of linear programming using minizinc

Some examples where linear programming is used.

## The (famous) whiskas problem (whiskas.mzn)

My first effort was to solve the famous whiskas problem using minizinc
because I did not find another effort to solve this using minizinc.
Can be used to compare with other frameworks.

Just download the MiniZinkIDE and load whiskas.mzn. The solver
OSICBC 2.9/1.16 solves this problem pretty fast. 

## Some area which has certain properties (flaeche.mzn)
Given two rectangles (*Rechteck* in german) and some properties
find the sizes of the two rectangles.

Should be providing an picture here so it easier to understand.
